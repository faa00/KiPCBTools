# Kipcbtools
The warehouse of the plug -in in order to solve the plug -in in order to solve the KICAD built -in function defect

# Freediffpair
** Free angle differences pair / free angle differential pair generator **

BUG:
> - Waiting for feedback / waiting ...

How to use
> 0. Plug -in strictly requires input line segments: The selected differential pair must be parallel parallel, the selected single -end line must be completely continuous (unique fold line).
> 1. Select a section or multiple single -end line connected to one of the differential pairs to the differential pair,
> 2. The use of a plug -in will generate another differential line on the other side of the single -end line.
> 3. This plug-in is only designed for normal line segments, only meets normal needs, and is still in the testing stage.

How to use
> 0. The plug-in strictly requires the input tracks: The Selected Differential Pairness Be Sufficiently Parallel, and The SelectEd Single-ended Tracks Must Be coming Pletely Continuous (Unique Polyline).
> 1. Select A Difference;
> 2. using the plug-in will generate the Other Side Differential Tracks Based on the Single-Ended Tracks.
> 3. This plug-in is only designed for normal layout, only normal requirements, and is strong in the testing stage.
